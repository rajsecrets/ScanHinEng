# OCR & Keyword Search Web Application

This project is a **web-based prototype** that demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on an uploaded image containing text in both **Hindi and English**. The application also provides a basic keyword search functionality to highlight the searched words from the extracted text. The web app is deployed and accessible via a live URL.

## üìñ Overview
This application allows users to:
1. Upload an image containing Hindi and/or English text.
2. Perform **OCR** on the image to extract the text.
3. Search for specific keywords in the extracted text, with results highlighted.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Extracts text from images containing both Hindi and English using the `easyocr` library.
- **Keyword Search:** Allows users to search for keywords in the extracted text and highlights them.
- **Language Detection:** Identifies if the text contains Hindi, English, or both.
- **Text Download:** Users can download the extracted text in a `.txt` file format.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Streamlit:** Web framework to build the app UI.
- **EasyOCR:** OCR tool to extract Hindi and English text from images.
- **PIL (Pillow):** Image processing library.
- **Numpy:** Handling image arrays for OCR processing.
- **Regex:** Used for keyword matching and highlighting.
- **Lottie Animations:** For smooth UI loading animations.
